        "📝 Capture: Collect what resonates using quick notes and highlights - Capture fleeting ideas before they disappear by developing a habit of noticing what resonates and immediately saving it. Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Focus on capturing material that's surprising, useful, or personally meaningful rather than everything. Create a system where capturing takes seconds, not minutes.",
        "Actionable steps: - Install a note-taking app on all your devices with one-click saving, Use a QuickContact Capture inbox for raw ideas without worrying about organization yet, Practice the 10-second rule: if something takes longer than 10 seconds to capture, simplify your method, Develop personal symbols or shorthand to mark different types of captured information",

        "🗂️ Organize: Save for actionability with the PARA method - Structure information based on how you'll use it, not what it's about. The PARA system—Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives—organizes by actionability rather than subject matter. This makes retrieval contextual to your actual work instead of creating theoretical categories.",
        "Actionable steps: - List all your current projects (finite outcomes with deadlines), Identify your areas of responsibility (ongoing commitments), Create resource folders for topics of interest, Set up an archive for completed projects and inactive areas, Schedule a weekly review to maintain this system",

        "🔍 Distill: Find the essence by progressive summarization - Extract the essential points from your notes through layers of highlighting and summarization. This creates multiple layers of detail that you can navigate based on your needs. Progressive summarization preserves context while making content increasingly actionable through layers of distillation.",
        "Actionable steps: - First layer: Capture the original content, Second layer: Bold the most important sentences, Third layer: Highlight the most important phrases within bolded sentences, Fourth layer: Create an executive summary in your own words, Apply this only to notes you actually revisit—don't process everythin.",

         "🗣️ Express:  Share your personal insights and creations - Knowledge only becomes valuable when expressed and shared. Transform what you've captured and processed into your own creative output. This completes the cycle of knowledge by moving from consumption to creation, allowing your ideas to take new forms and reach others.",
        "Actionable steps: - Schedule regular time for creative output using your notes -Start with Intermediate Packets — small, complete components rather than finished works, Maintain a creativity💡 inbox of your best ideas ready for expression, Practice REMIX creativity by combining ideas from different sources, Share works-in-progress to get feedback earlier in your creative process",

        "🌀 Convergence: Move from scattered ideas to coherent thoughts - Allow related ideas to naturally converge over time rather than forcing immediate connections. Give your subconscious mind time to process and connect disparate pieces of information. The best insights often come from unexpected connections between previously unrelated notes.",
        "Actionable steps: - Use tags, links, or connections between notes to identify emerging patterns, Schedule periodic review sessions to look for unexpected connections, Create EMERGENCE NOTES when you notice ideas converging naturally, Maintain a SLOW BURN list of questions or problems to revisit over months, Practice idea incubation by deliberately setting aside complex problems",

        "💻 Digital Organization: Leverage technology for knowledge management - Use digital tools strategically to overcome the limitations of your biological memory. Digital notes can be searched, backed up, reorganized, and shared instantly. The goal isn't to create a perfect system but one that reduces friction between capturing ideas and putting them to use.",
        "Actionable steps: - Choose tools based on interoperability and longevity, not just features - Implement a consistent file naming convention (date-title works well), Set up automated backups and sync across devices, Create templates for common note types you frequently use, Use search operators and saved searches for rapid information retrieval",

        "⚡ Productivity: Turn information into actionable results -Transform passive knowledge into concrete outcomes by designing projects around your notes. Information is only valuable when it helps you achieve your goals. Each project should draw from your knowledge management system and contribute back to it.",
        "Actionable ⚡ steps: - Define clear project outcomes before beginning researc - Create Project Support notes to gather relevant information, Practice Just-in-Time 🔍 research rather than excessive up-front collection, Implement a weekly review to identify which notes can support current projects, Maintain a Success Spiral by completing small knowledge-based projects first, Develop feedback loops to measure how your knowledge system contributes to outcomes, RetryClaude can make mistakes.

This isn't just motivational talk—it's mathematics, A 1% daily improvement for one year results in being 37 times better than when you started. Focus on consistent tiny improvements rather than radical transformations.",
                "🔄 Habit Loop: Cue, craving, response, reward framework - Every habit follows this four-step pattern: The cue triggers your brain to initiate behavior, the craving provides motivation, the response is the actual habit performed, and the reward satisfies your craving and teaches your brain to remember this pattern. Understanding this loop helps you diagnose and change any habit.",
                "👁️ Make It Obvious: Design your environment for success - Your environment shapes your behavior more than your willpower. Visible cues trigger habits, so design your space to make good habit cues obvious and bad habit cues invisible. Use implementation intentions (I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]) and habit stacking (After [current habit], I will [new habit]).",
                "🍯 Make It Attractive: Use temptation bundling - Pair activities you need to do with activities you want to do. Connect the habit with something you enjoy, creating a neurological Attraction to the behavior. This works because the anticipation of reward—not just the reward itself—drives behavior.",

Decrease friction for good habits by preparing your environment in advance, and increase friction for bad habits by creating obstacles.
